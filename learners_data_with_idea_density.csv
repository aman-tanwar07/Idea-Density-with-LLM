          Dear Manager,
          I would like to complain about your theatre and the musical show that I saw last week.
          I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about 'Over the rainbow' in the hotel which I stayed in.
          I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited. However, Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time. I was really disappointed about it. Secondly, the starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waitedwaiting for 45 minutes. It was sosuch a long time to wait in the theatre.
          Thirdly, it mentioned about discounts. Despite of the fact that I am a student, I could not get any discounts. I also visited your restaurant after the show but it was already closed because the show finished late.
          Because ofFor the reasonreasons above, I, indeed, spent an awful last night in London.
          I would like you to refund, otherwise, I will take an action.
          I look forward to receiving a reply to my enquiry.
          Sincerely",5.9

There will be two functions for summer clothes that we don't need to wear clothes like layer and layer. For example, T-shirts for women are includedwill include a bra: easy to take it out when you wash it, and it is very simple and comfortable. What about short pants? You don't have to wear knickers. We can just put some thin pads in there. We can't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it. Simplest is the best in summer!
          When it's very cold in winter, we just wear light clothes what we want, in our style. Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and useused them inside thin clothes so we don't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies. We can show our body linefigure in winter as well.

          I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London.
          I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking at and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement aboutfor a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.
          This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start andat ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip willwould be cut downreduced.
          I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the ragetrends but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designerdesigners later on.
          I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time.
          Please give this your careful consideration..

We take our homes for granted. Think about the people in the poor countries! They struggle to survive. However, as we approach the future, our homes will start to change.
          Have you ever thought about how the changes will affect our lives? I doubt it.
          There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities. For one, the future homeshome might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass. Non-breakable glass. Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and the risk of flooding will also rise. Therefore, houses will be built on high supports. All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated. Incredibly high security will prevent robbery.
          The future homes will also have many similarities, such as having a separate bathroom, and not having one in a bedroom, or having two floors or having garages.

          The festival was excenentexcellent in many ways, and especiallyin particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets withat the propernormal price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.
          However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars  who participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiencesattendees. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres ofin neither the films noreither the films or the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more numbers of plays and films next year.

          People all have different opinions about books. Some prefer realistic stories whereas others doprefer unusual ones. But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea'.
          Above all, realistic stories teach me something ofabout the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up on taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.
          In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives.
          We all learn from reading books, but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality. That's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones.",9.56

          When it comes to modern technology, I grately appreciate it.

          Third thing is athe telephone. It saves time. Whenever I do not know about something, I phone someone and ask about it.

          I am writing to you because I have recently been atto your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening.
          I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertismentadvertisement that there were some discounts available. I asked forabout it but the answer I received was that there wasn'tweren't any kind of discountdiscounts. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at thethat moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant idea to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed!
          I think that if there had been only one or two problems I wouldn't have written to replycomplain but there had beenwere only problems. I'd like not only to replycomplain but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't ""perfect"" as you advertised but it was a big disaster.

          Dear Sir or Madam,
          Please find enclosed my thinkingthoughts about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the mannerway actuallyat present how the people are dressingpeople are dressing at present to see how it's going to be developpeddeveloped intoin the future. Everyone has ishis own style but it's obvious that many of us isare wearing the same clothes likeas others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousersshort trousers and yesterday it was wearing broken-jeansbroken jeanstorn jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models, the mediasmedia, or new collectioncollections, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive, that'swhich's why maybemaybe why not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each peopleeveryone will developpdevelop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, inas a way to create their own clothes.
          In my opinion, I think that people will wear nonot wear clothes anymore, just beingbe natural, being nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticitytheir authenticity again.

          Firstly, concerning the stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musicsmusic like jazz and rock, it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about  bigger halls, it will bewould be better.

          Firstly, it was meant to start at 19:30 aand I bought my ticket for the evening sessionperformance. However, it began at 20:15. I would have understood a little bit of waiting time, but everybody agreed that this was too long.
          Second, instead of being starredstarring by Danny Brook, the musical was starredstarring by another actor, who I found really disappointing. Although he sung quite well he danced terribly and that spoiled part of the show.
          I asked forabout the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them.
          In addition, we had planned to have dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed as it closes every Thursday. I think that there's no point in having a restaurant which closes the day of mainthe audience is largest.
          Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement saidpromised and that we all wishedwanted turned out to be a regretregrettable forbecause of the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm includingenclosing my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for returning some money.

          Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter.
          You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes!
          Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groupsgroup's instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as mymany balloons as we cancould and sprayed them with gold and silver.
          The concert went terrificterrifically, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having athe time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me!
          At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alreadalready left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night!
          Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it!
          Anyway, now I'm back to the real world - I have exams next week, wish me luck!

This idea is in relation withrelates to the number of plays and films.

I was there for two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world.
          Well, here are some of my opinionopinions and suggestions. First of all, I think there should be more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists only fromfrom only six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world.
          The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls which were totoo small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent.
          Actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificientmagnificent events.

          In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either.

          I am writing about an annual international arts festival with a good impression. I have spent two days on it which was exciting. However, I would like to make a suggestion that you could consider for it.
          The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is a great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only fromfrom only six countries apart from your advertisement. I suppose more countries are going to be informed even during and after the events.
          The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classicclassical music, which were fantastic. However, there were some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for the audience, so a few people had to stand and watch the concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised.
          As well as that, I expect you plays and films are performed more. Even if the majority of my friends had a good time there I saw some people would anticipate it, because there were many people who were impressed in it.
          Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket. It is aan excellent price because when I am tempttempted to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money. At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommandrecommend it to other friends. That's how I am feeling about that.

          But it is quite different rather than you. Becoming more strict gradually at home that at school is true as you said.
          Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children. I think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing. For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now. What else, unless they pass the exam they have to gethave extra lessonlessons or testtests. But most teachers consult with their parents, so itif they behave wrongly it is true that teachers call their parents.
          Apart from that, at home, children are not allowed to use impolite words and on the weekend they have to help parents to do some chores.

I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me.

Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to havetake a seat and the show finally beginnedbegan at 8:15!

          First of all, the only month I will be able to visit the U.S.A. is July due to the fact that I have already arranged another trip for August.
          Second of allSecondly, I would prefer to livestay in a tent. I am used to this kind of accommodation since I have been taking part in survival camps for a long time.
          As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing. The reason offor my decision is that other activities are availiableavailable to take alsoalso available in my countycountry, except climbing, but I have a fear of heights so this one is not destinateddestined for people like me.
          Furthermore, I would like to ask you some questions. What type of clothes should I take and how much money would be enough? Is this a kind of ""all inclusive"" holidaysholiday?
          Thank you in advance.
          Yours faithfully,

          Dear Kim,
          I think I told you about my plans of enteringjoiningto join a group that helps at concerts, didn't I? Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert. Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium. There waswere about 100 000 people. We had a lot of things to do. AcctuallyActually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific.
          After the concert many people lost their way home, mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule. We had to order taxis for them as they didn't have mobile telephones. However, they were very nice people.
          I didn't manage to meet Michael as I had expected, but apart from that, I really enjoyed the time I spent there.
          You should also try it.
          Best wishes,

When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was notnone was available. At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best itI would costpay what they saidasked.

          When the show started the person who was acting in it was not Danny Brook and hethe replacement seemed notdidn't seem to be an actor. Really he was bad. Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed. So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had.

          Dear Madam,
          I'm writing this letter to congratulate you foron the excellent international arts festival we could enjoyenjoyed last November. I foundthink it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think cancould be improved in the followingfuture editionsyears.
          First of all, because of the advertisement I expected startsstars and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries. Artists from different cultures maycould make the festival even more interesting.
          Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to foundfind that some of them were sold out because of the shortreduced number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it canmight be a good idea to setarrange more projections next year. Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full weekweek's festival.
          Finally, the prizeprice was reasonablyreasonable and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend.
          I hope you'll attendact on my suggestions.
          Yours sincerely,",5.02

          I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival.'
          First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatfulgreat success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet. However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year.
          To begin with, you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in. In fact, theirthere were only six countries involved. My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries.
          Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely totoo small or in other words totoo many people attended those concerts. This kind of problem you could avoidYou could avoid this kind of problem whenif you look for big halls at the beginingbeginningoutset.
          Another point where you could improve is whenif you show more plays and films next year.
          Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea withof the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attempattend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
          To finish this letter with, I would like to give you a good idea for next year. In my opinion it would be nice if you createcreated an exhibition placespace where the guests can try to play different instruments.

          I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it. Anyway the people wherewho asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes totoo much work.
          A traditional way to earn money, in theyour spare time, is to bringdeliver newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problemsproblem that you have here is the weather. For example when it is rainy, because then everything getgets wet.
          Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help forwith changing the film rolls, for cleaning the toilets or to dodoing some other small jobs.
          But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something wherethat you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people. Of course in the beginingbeginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at it you'll also earn some money.

          Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewellsjewelsjewellery, furnituresfurniture, etc. and you could have a realreally great time.

          The aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. This is based on a questionnairquestionnaire conducted in the school and our English department's investigation.
          Lessons
          According to statistics based on the questionnairquestionnaire, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speakernative-speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some EnglisheEnglish classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore, lessfewer numbers of students were nodding off comparingcompared with other classes like Maths. Consequently, it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphereatmosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of the English department.
          Extra activities
          It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been onat the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keenesskeenness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed.
          Conclusion
          To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of booksbookworms but also enjoying our school life. It might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of.",8.13

          In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. ActualyActually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion inon which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant situationoccasion. In fact, the shopping you do for theyour daily needs is seldom enjoubleenjoyable, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morovermoreover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need itto, shopping can be a very nice activity.
          Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all whatthat I can using ""on-line"" services.

          But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year's festival to make it absolutellyabsolutely wonderful. First of all, you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world, because there arewere people only from six countries. I think it can make your festival more popular.
          Jazz, rock and classical concerts are amazing, but I think that some concert halls are too small, so not everybody can come.
          Your dance shows are very beautiful, the art exhibitionsexhibition is something original and exciting. And also it is very interesting to talk with writers.

          As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre situationsexperiences I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink.
          It is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd, having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers, trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping. Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts.
          Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirebleundesirable pains.
          Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stakerisk. They keep claiming that there's no such thing asthere's nothing better than shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces.",4.84

          I am writing to tell you about my experience at a pop concert last month.
          As you know, I am a member of a BSB fan club, and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live. FirstlyFirst, I helped sellingsell the tickets. That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go. The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to haveget everything in order so the concert could be a successuccess, which it was.
          What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talktalking with them about their lifeslives as members of a pop group. I also enjoyed being able to work as part of a team with both all the members of the club and the BSB. It was one of the best experiences I have had in all my life
          I am looking forward to hearing from you. Please write to me soon or call me. My new phone number is (958) 1217653

          I recently spent two days at this festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year.
          It's very good that you organised an International Arts Festival in our country, but in my opinion, if this is an international festival, it wouldshould hashave more stars and artists from around the world, not from only six countries, like it was this year.
          It was a great idea for doingto do something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concerts hallconcert halls were too small for all the people, who took a part atinattended that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also it a great idea waswas a great idea, that it wasto have one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.
          I think, as a person, who in this festival took placepart inattendedattended this festival, that thisit iswas excellent, because we cancould spend a lot of time with art. There is only one bad fhingthing, that this festival was too short. In my opinion, next year it should take place over much longermore than two days.

          You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remindreminds me of what I experienced during my teeenageteenage years. In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are atin the first year of being a teenageteenager. YourYou know, this age is the troubletroublesome age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. TheseThey always annoy the school teacherschoolteacher and their parents. InAs a result of thesethis, the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak to each other in the class. They hadhave to finish homework inwithin a limited time. They cannot oppose to the teacher, girls are not allowed to wear make upmake-up andor wear any accessoriesjewellery. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me mucha lot of amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbiddenforbade me to makehave a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home, many of my friendfriends had the same experience.
          Now I'm a mother of two children. They are allboth in the school. ComparingCompared to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother ofto them and a friend ofto them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don'tdoesn't give students so much homework, and don'tdoesn't forbiddenforbid the opposite voice of the students, there areis nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad.

          As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I likeliked it and getgot quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether Iwe cancouldwould be able and willing to help forwith the concert in two weeksweeks' time in the concert hall. I immediately saysaid ""yes"" and alsoso did my friend. I really thinkthought it soundssounded so interesting. I havehad never done light and sound for thea real pop concert before and I thinkthought it willwould be a good experience for me. Actually I'veI'd just done light and sound infor a drama'sdrama day inat my school at the end of last term. But this time it'llit'd be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television.?
          The preperationpreparation days came. TheOn the first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobsjob areiswas preparingto prepare for the concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzingamazing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we havehad to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing a stage, lightlights, sound, and background. I felt like I'mI was one of those professionalprofessionals too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thingthings from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always likeare? It was good fun though! , butBut my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyedenjoy it as much as I dodid.
          At the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of thethose professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition makemakes me to trytry to work very hard and this term I getgot A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it, if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much, now. Now I have my aim aboutfor what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder.

          Dear Jane
          Firstly, I want to tell you that the idea of the ""International Arts Festival"" was a really great idea. I enjoyed the festival pretty much. However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange littlesmall details.
          I think that next year you should have more artists from different countries, so that it can be a real International Festival. This also would take more attraction to the festival.
          Another point which I think was ennoyingannoying, areiswas the concert hallshall. The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so muchmany people. I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall.
          The plays and the films were really great. I enjoyed all of them. I hope to see muchmany more films next year.
          The best thing about the festival was the price I think, because it madehad a really big effect on the attraction, and that of course made the festival much more enjoyable.
          I again want to say that it was really nice to be at the festival. I believe that next year will be better if you consider my ideas.

          Dear Andrew,
          I just received your letter and decided you to write back now; because of your questions which were about the rules. I'm really tired of the rules in school!
          Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatlyunfortunately the school that I'm going to is like a military camp. The uniform, we are wearingwear has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict, however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example, if you don't come to school for 10 days in a year, weyou fail that year.
          Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thingeverything except smoking and drinking alcholalcohol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen toplay music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to.
          This is all that I can tell you about my school and family. Rules are every whereeverywhere and you can't change them. So just don't think about them.

          Kim, I would like to tell you my wonderful experience last month! On 5th of May, which was a national holiday in Japan, I had a part-time workjob at a pop concert in the Tokyo Dome.
          The pop singer was called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan. The concert was startstarted at 7.00 p.m. At that time I was inon the second floor where I had to work is. I did a part of gard job. I stood up in front of the audiencesaudience and I had given an attention to them. I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs. I thought if you were here I could really enjoy it with you.
          All of her funsfans were stooudstood up the whole concert and dancing. I was so exciting night.
          Some of the funsfans were not good at all because they shouted and argued, but most of the people were very good. I had enjoyed so much with my wonderful experiencemy wonderful experience so much.

          Dear Mrs Ryan:
          I am very glad I won the Competition to go to Camp California.
          I must say though, I would have to travel onin July because it's the summer holydaysholidays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friendfriends if itthat is possible.
          Log cabinesLog cabinsA log cabinsA log cabin willwould be the ideal accomodationaccommodation, presumably. Presumably they are more spacious than tenttents and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing, which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at it. Climbing would be my second option, but for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction forbecause I've only done it a few times.
          I would like to know how much money do people ussuallyusually take and how manymuch clothesclothing.

          Well, you want to know what I did inat the concert? Help..
          I know it soundsounds extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my suprisesurprise it turned out to be much more fun thatthan expected.
          About 20 people were helping apart from me, we. We had somea kind of rotation system so that all the volunteers could also enjoy some of the concert.
          Of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakesbreaks. The hard work, though, started when everyone left at the end of the concert. It was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not, all the popstarspop stars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-oversleftovers!
          It was so fun, thatand I enjoyed it a lot. If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers tell me, I'm in!!!

          Firstly, you cannot always get the right onething although you scour about all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired on your feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially, on the special occasionoccasions like onduring a sale. Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get robbed by a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of thathow you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home.
          In addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home. Sometimes, a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you.

          Mr. Manager of the Circle Theatre,
          While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, ""Over The Rainbow"", because I had read the addad onin the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was.
          One of the reasonreasons I went to see that particular show, was the starring actor, announced in the addad, to be Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, withafter forty fiveforty-five minutesminutes' delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The addad also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason!
          It is for these reasons that I expect a full refund of the ticket prizeprice, it. It is my right as a paying customer to get what I have paid for. Looking forward to hearing from you.",4.26

          The aim of this report is to summarize the results of a survey about lessons and other activities which should be filmed. This report is based on a sample of over 80 students of my school.
          FavoriteFavourite lessons
          Interestingly, over half of the students who were asked enjoy attending history class, while 30 per cent are keen to take an art and music class, and a small number of the student (less than 15 per cent) like to take social studies class.

          Not surprisingly, football was well-preferred as an activity which students do after school generally (over 30 per cent) and also about 25 per cent preferred baseball. Amazingly, over 20 per cent of the students would like to take up handball from next year.

          First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took a long time to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get totoo excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans.

           More and more people like shopping now. You can see so many people walk along the business street every day and any time, especially in Oxford Street. Sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people's working expressspeed. But is it always enjoyable?
          Of course not. The most obvious example is that when you're shopping in the shop you're not sure which one you are going to buy, you turn to the people who sell them, but they sometimes ignore you. So you like them but you don't want them any more. It makes you angry!
          Also, for example., you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone telltells you ""I'm sorry, this one is sold out""! What a pity! You become unhappy immediately.
          And sometimes, for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from £50 down to £20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much.

          I think it's a very good thing that people read books on the radio because it's aan possibilityopportunity for ""busy people"" to knowhear important and beautiful short stories and books.
          Well, I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book. I read it two months ago and I liked it very much. It's a sad story but it makeslets you know about a tipetype of life that you can't imagine that really exists. The old man is a sad person but he loves his livelife and lives on the beach because he can't staygo without seeseeing the sea for a day.
          I think you will enjoy it.
          Now I have to stop writing but I'll write you more letters.

If you choosechose the post, you would be exhausted throughllythoroughlythoroughly exhausted inat the end of the concert. However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert. As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby.

I have just been staying in a tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interestedinteresting adventure.

          Dear Sirs,
          I am writing to complain about my awful evening at the Circle Theatre. I am very disappointed.
          Last week I went to see a musical show called 'OVER THE RAINBOW' at the Circle Theatre.
          I was firstat first, very excited to seebe seeing the show, because onin the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I cancould have a perfect evening at there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening.
          I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started latelater thenthan I expected. It should berun from 7,307.30 p.m., but it wasstarted fromat 8.15 p.m.!
          I want to complain about the ticket. OnIn the advertisement it said that discounts arewere availbleavailable, but when I asked a staffmember of staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went to the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed earlyearlier than usual. I think they should keep the times correctly.
          I am very disappointed with everything whatthat happened last week.
          I would like a refund.
          I excpectexpect this will be possible.

          I think everyone will wear balloons for clothes in the future. Every oneEveryone will wear very colourful balloons on them. With balloon clothes they will be able to fly up in the sky.
          Everyone will not walkNo one will walk on roads. They will bouncedbounce on roads with theretheir balloon clothes.
          In the future they will wear balloon clothes, because to make people fly. They will use a special gas inside the balloons to make them fly.
          For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will be notnot be dangerous. If we use up carbon dioxide within our balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about Ozone breaking. This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in the future. It is to savewill save our Earth.

After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the pointsreasons becausewhy, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't playappear! So when the miserable musical came to hisits end, we were happy to leave the theatertheatre roomauditorium, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantesrestaurants were openedopen anymore, because it started too late.

          I am writing to answerprovide the informationsinformation that you need from me.
          First I would like to thank you for doingorganising this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize.
          Answering your questions, I would like to travel only enin July because this is the month of my vacationsvacation. In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please.
          According to your letter, I have two options ofregarding accommodation, oreither in tents or log cabins. I would prefer ina tentstent because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I never stayedhave never stayed in a tentstent in the middle of nowhere, in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more confortablecomfortable, on.  On the other hand I think that I will be able to ""survive"" in a tentstent. Looking toat your letter, I can see many options offor activities and I realizedrealize that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason offor choosing thisthese two activities is that they contrast with itselvesthemselveseach other,. I want one that is more exciting and that asks for more agility and another that is more calmcalmer and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good onat thatit, however, I wishhope that I can learn about it onat the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doingat it.
          I have some doubtsworries about my prize and travel. Is there aany possibility that you could send me a list of materialequipment and clothes that I have to take?
          Is alleverything on the traveltrip already paid for, including food and meals, or do I have to bring some money?
          Do I have to bring something especialspecial for the tentstent and camping?

          There was a concert ofwith a famous band here in my city. I vishwish you werehad been here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan'sfans' bus. Yes, there is a bus that taketakes you to the concert and bringbrings you back.
          The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00. When we enteredgot inside of it, we saw a lot of fans usingwearing T-shirts, caps and shouting, ""Almendegos, Almendegos..."" (that is the name of the band).
          AT 20:00, we stopped inat a coffee house to eat. TheThey shouted: ""20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave.""
          We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him sovery much. After a few minutes (I foughtthought they were a few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked toat my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes before. The man offered us a ride. We acceptaccepted. You can notcannot imagine how dissapointeddisappointed I werewas with my ownselfmyself.
          When we arrived the concert had already beganbegun. When we were running to enter a man called us. He was helping to put the materialsequipment of the concertsconcertconcert equipment (microphone...) on the stage. He asked if we could help. We answered: ""Yes!""

This included to cleancleaning up the rooms which were used by the singers and putputting some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and apply make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could staybe at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stagebackstage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his signatureautograph. He was fantastic, you. You know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge.

The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls werebeing too small. The Playsplays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I joinedattended the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows madewere a sight for our soursore eyes,; they were really fascinating.

          I'm writing to Youyou in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been atto. I also hope, that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it ""international"" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (mentionedsaid to be ""from around the world"") were from only six countries. Maybe the easonreason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain, why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones.
          On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose from impressed me the most. I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year.

          Re: Daily life at our school.
          As requested, itI hashave collected some information about the school. Below is a summary of the most important releventrelevant points with some recommendations.
          1. The fully-equippedfully equipped computer centre in the main building is extremellyextremely good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well. However, there are nonot enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs. I suggest to increaseincreasing the number of them, because it will be more exitingexciting to film.
          2. The school arranges an amasingamazing range of activities, such as excuintionsexcursions, sports and different kinds of trips. Although there is plenty for us to do during the day, the most funnyfunniest events happen while we are playing basketball and football. I must say, I think this is the best time for making a short video.
          Conclusion.
          Our school is an ideal place for making a short video. There are many interesting lessons and other activities. I do recommend, however, to makemaking a short video about
          a) lessons in the computer centre
          b) basketball and football games.",8.45

          First of all, I would like to travel only in the month of July, because during the month of June, I'm going to work and in September I have to study a lot, because school will start . Speaking aboutRegarding accommodation, between tents and log cabins, I woulwould prefer a tentstent, because I love the adventure and also because I can be freer.
          I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have choosenchosen two from your list: Basketballbasketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been taking partpart inof a strong team for three years.
          The other one I have choosenchosen is swimming; for the same reason why I chose Basketballbasketball. But, what about clothes, money, food?

In my opinion to do shopping is often funnyfun, above all when you can enter without difficulties into a shopa shop without difficulties. For exempleexample, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because they will create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of leavingwasting time. Shopping is a funnyfun thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have some free time and when you can relax yourself.

          Dear Sir,

          I saw your advertisement and I expected a discounted ticket for students. But in athe ticket office I realised I couldn't get it. Another problem was the time. The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed, so at 20.15 athe curtain of the stage was pulled upraised. As soon as the play had started I noticed another problem. I am a big fan of Danny Book and itthat was why I chose 'over the rainbow'. When I saw a different actor playing his role I was really disappointed.
          LasLastThe last problem I would like to tell you about is about athe restarauntrestaurant there. After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed because offor decoration.
          When I booked the ticket I really expectedlooked forward to the show. Unlike my expectation it was so disappointing and annoying. So I would like to ask for some money back.
          I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Try to imagine the scencescene: twenty or thirty or even more people are keepingin a quelqueue outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buywant to buy a T-shirt?

After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badlybad after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable?

And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns'stone age wherewhen money was not even invented.

I also helped to serve people who would like drinkto drink,. I was like a barman.

          I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival.
          Last season I spent two days at the Festival. I enjoyed myself very much, but I think that the organization of the next festival could be better.
          First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can knowget to know artists who camescomescome from different countries. Unfortunately, in the last edition there werethe artists who camescame from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa.
          Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts offor different kindkinds of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hallconcert halls were too small, and because of itthat I couldn't see one of the concerts inon the programme.
          In my opinion, one of the best things ofabout the last Festival was that there were not only concerts there. I saw films and I played ping-pong. InAt the next edition will there be more or less of that? I hope moreMore I hope. The thing that I liked much more than othersanything else, was that I had to buy onlyonly had to buy one ticket for all the events, and it was nonot pricey.
          It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you,. I think you should dohave a baby-parkingkindergarten, in. In fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their sonschildren.

Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although, it hadwas supposed to start at 19:30. Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening, and I think you should know that tickettickets were sold without any discounts.

          You remember I helped people at a pop concert as a nurse last month? You can't imagine how happy I am to have had such a wonderful chanceopportunity.
          As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop maniamaniac. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of an electric shock onto his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accidentaccidents so I could enjoy the concert without a hurry. I was definitely over the moon!

          I like shopping very much. Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food from. For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat. Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals. On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive.
          The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style by buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendantsassistants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time.
          The third reason I enjoy shopping is that I never go alone just to buy a thing I need. I always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe. Although my brother thinks the better way to have fun is to watch TV than to be pushed in crowded shops, I do not agree.
          To sum up, I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable, but for me it is and I like it.",6.48

          I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by visitingseeing it. I believed in the phrase bywith which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect.
          The show should have started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened. I waited and it becomesbecame 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened. At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know. I was very wrong and afraid about it and I rememberremembered that this was the third problem thisthat evening. ByWhen arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available. Now I asked myself if there willwould comebe another problem. The problem came. The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show for eatingto eat something, was closed without any explainationexplanation and the perfect evening was completely unperfectimperfect.
          I think thisthese are reasons enough for enquiringto enquire about getting some money back.
          I would be gladlyglad to get an answer from you.
          Faithfully,

          Dear manager,
          During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'. In the advertismentadvertisement you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't. So with this letter I want to ask for some money back. Now I want to explain about the problems. It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, how itas was toldpromised in the advertismentadvertisement. It was also toldalso toldalso said that the evening shows are startingstarted at 19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of  illness. So I want to ask for my money back, also because I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertismentadvertisement. I hope you will answer my letter and correctsolve the problems inat your theatre.

For me modern technology areis things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, Hifihi-fi sound systems, television or even cars. But are they are usefulluseful in every situation and everywhere? My oppinionopinion is that modern technology can help you to save time. In my case for example my car is very time-saving. If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hourhours before training, I start a halfhalf an hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. TheOne finds the same problem with mobile phones, if I gotgethave one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I have got the Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every bodyeverybody should use the his saved timethe time he has saved for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a ""natural life"" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots. We should also move our body and not only use our brain.",8.53

          Modern technology has changed my daily life in the pointsense that alleverything I do is becoming more comfortableeasier. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search for something like a telefonnumbertelephone number or an adressaddress I also look it up fromon the internetInternet.

          I think the advantage of modern technology is that alleverything I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbyshobbies or for friends.
          Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV soundssound better and the pictures on TV are being impovedimproved, because the machines become more betterbetter.

For example, your advertisement said that the starringstars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not themthere! TheyThere were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond. For me, this a big mistake. This eventproblem was not the only one because another problem was the respect ofwith respect to the time. Your advertisement said that the show willwould start at 19:30 PM, but it has startedstarted at 20:15 PM. I don't like to have such big change in time. The third problem was that it was writtingwritingwritten that the discounts were available, but when I getgot there it was not true. The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation.

          Modern technology, such as computercomputers, carcars and other elsethings, changedhave changed my life in many different ways likesuch as communication, travelingtravelling and working.

          Why do people like shopping? FirstThe first answer is that they need to go shopping. SecondThe second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel like going shopping. When I dogo shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but only if it is possible to do the shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for.
          I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend, she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time.
          If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really a good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time.
          Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad a situation you are in because when I was a child I always had an argumentarguments with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very ashamefulshameful for my mum. She was also very angry. Because because she never managed to get me out fromof the toy shop.

          If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. ""Cry Freedom"", fromby John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice?
          Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the AppartheidApartheidapartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitoutwithout reading the book more than one timeonce. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries.
          However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage, the love of justice, the fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just aslike the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythesmythslegends, and ""Cry Freedom"" is one of them.
          To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story.",4.67

Many people leaveforget so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitieactivity always enjoyable?'
          Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strenghstrength that practisingdoing a sport or even going to work requirerequires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money.
          However, this apparently quitequiet and relaxed activitieactivity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy bywith the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her.

          The advertisement that you distributed through all the magazines weewas totally untrue. Which so called ""Rip off"".
          First of all, you said Danny Brook iswas in the play but a different actor was in the rollrole. It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason, I mean the main reason, which made me to gogo was to see Danny Brook.
          Secondly, about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to the late start, it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait out sideoutside for another hour to get a taxi.

          What about after 100 years? I believe we'll be more into fashionable stuffsstuff. As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperationsinspirations that we get from all sortsorts of enviromentenvironmentenvironments.
          Development of scienceScientific developments produce new materials like water proofwaterproof or fire prooffireproof fabrics. For example, CastumCostume of AstronutsAstronautsspace suits.
          These days we are very intrestedinterested in space and the milleniummillennium and things and many designers have showedshown milleniummillennium looks recently. But we don't wear them. Frankly we can't because we think it's too odd or strange.
          But what about 100 yearyears later? I expect human being'llbeings'llbeings will live inon the other planets and treveltravel around under the sea.

Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays.

          But maybe you are too shy to do this. In this case, you can cook some cakes and sell them near a school or in the centre of the city, as well as other traditional products: cheese, honey ,chocolate...
          Another thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures. You don't need to be a Picasso,: it'sis enough with a bit of imaginationa bit of imagination is enough.

          Dear Ms Clark,
          I am writing to mention my opinions on the International Arts Festival that you have organised this year. It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory.
          First of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it.
          Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of auditionaudience. They were cold and moistdamp, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficientinadequate.
          Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all the events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided.
          Finally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it. I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year.
          Yours sincerely,",7.22

          Dear Mary,
          I'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here.
          Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural personperson plural (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected.
          Another thing that is different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period.
          Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us'our parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m.
          I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still onessome coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules.

          For these reasons, we would like to suggest you to gogo to the show instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon.

          I am sure that our traveltrip is going to be great.

          In the advertisement, it was writtenwrotesaid that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was something disappointing.

As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses. And of course, they were black-andblack and white. Their hobieshobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.

First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the brochureflyer. I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed.
          I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too. Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even ifthough I had read on the brochureflyer that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed.

Also fast and well-improvedhigh-tech carcars increase athe riskrisks of pollution ofin our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents.

But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious, that celebretiescelebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, whatwhich makes their life miserable.
          The first point I would like to make is that athe private life of a celebrity is open to the public. I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildelywidely discussed in the mass-media. It is common knowledge, that such an attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family.
          Another aspect is that the children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention. They can't communicate with ordinary children andor attend ordinary schools.
          And last, but not least, is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, showshowing their real feelings to the public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering intoin their lives.

          We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping. IsIt is a kind of relief for them.
          Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jeweleryjewellery, anything. SpeciallyEspecially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking at all the newsnew things in the stores.
          But, sometimes, gogoing shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffectdefect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellersassistants don't treat us well sometimes.  Sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should have...
          So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it. It would probably be better if you just gowent shopping when you really needneeded and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music.

But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writtingwriting something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did it was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster amongto us. Pat heard that and he went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished them for their bad behavioursbehaviour.
          After that event happened, Pat was Jon and Tim's enemy. They both got into trouble because of him. They do hate him so much.",9.66

She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discountsdiscount tickets, we were saidtold there never were discount offers and that we had to pay for the highestmost expensive tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid offup. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait until 8.15 pm before it started, whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I.

In a hundred years, the clothes wouldwill certainly be totally differentsdifferent thanfrom ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and areour minds too.
          So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminiumaluminium bottles. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see.
          I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. SyntethicSynthetic materials have grown updeveloped and become very popular so itthey would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changedchange: large pants as ""baggy""""baggy"" pants, or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men'smen. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothesdressing. I guess they will wear a sort of tuniquetunic uponover a shirt and a skirt, or more malemasculine clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say thatwhat .
          Maybe Luc Besson's ""Fifth Element"" moviemovie ""Fifth Element"" is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view.

          During my visit to London, I had the opportunity to visit the Circle Theatre and to see 'Over the Rainbow'. To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected, as it completely contradicted to the advertisement.
          Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor was starringstarred in the actual show and his performance was literallyabsolutely horrible, and disappointing.
          Secondly the starting timestart of the show was far from punctual. I had gone to the show which according to the advertisementAccording to the advertisement, the show which I had gone to was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15.
          In the advertisement, it said that discounts were available. Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be offered.
          According to the advertisement, the audience were free to go to the theatre restaurant after the show. However, by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed.
          I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement, which statingstated that it would be my 'perfect evening out', when it was totallyquite the opposite.

If something comes up, she should inform the other staff. I was then taken inon to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different timetimes on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to the other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even sothough they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I thoughthought beforeat first. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting ongoing quite well.
          I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they changechanged their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talkingmaking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying ""thank-youthank you"" to the staff. Indeed, they can notcannot succeed without their help, can they?

          Dear Jane Clark,
          I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better. That is why I writeI'm writing to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not.
          Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is Internationalinternational. But in the advertisement it was writtensaid that the artists were from all over the world andbut I saw only six nationalities.
          Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent andbut the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk. In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year.
          Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment. ItThey attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that.
          Finally, the reasonablyreasonable price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kindkinds of people ancan afford to buy itthem. I also think that you should puthave a Snack-Barsnack bar or a little restaurant so asthat the people are not too hangryhungry and morevermoreover you can realise big benefitsmake a lot of profit.
          In conclusion, inon the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve it.
          I hope you will not take this letter as a complaint and I look forward to going to the next festival.

          I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow, the musical show, which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night. Being a theatre lover, I am always looking forward to seeing new musicals, but unfortunately, this particular one was very disappointing.
          First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even though it was stated in your advertisement that he would perform, but the main role was played by an unknown actor. Secondly, I had to wait for forty fiveforty-five minutes for the show to start, and it was 20:15 (not 19:30) when the curtain went up.
          Another disappointing thing was that I could not get anya student discount, even thatthough your advertisement promised them. To make things even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because of the roof repairs.
          As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one duringof my week's holiday in London. I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for £20 to pay the address above.

From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money onin our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who, with a smile on their faces, spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifisesacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighborneighbour jelousjealous.

          When I have readread this book, I have beenwas fascinated by the willwillpower of the old fisherfisherman. This willwillpower is so amazing, he has all the elements against him. His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance of to meetmeeting someoneanyone who could help him.
          But I don't think he would want to.
          He doen'tdoesn't want help because he wants to prove to the little boy and himself that he is not really old, even if he has a big agelived many years.
          I think thisthese are the reasons offor his willwillpower. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have triumphtriumphed otheover the fish because of his knowledge of the sea but it is principally because he has known research in the deeperdepths of his mind.

          As to the activities offered, I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping, although I am not quitevery good at the last one. Actually, I would like to take up photography as a hobby and if you can provide me with an opportunity to study in this area, I will accept it with pleasure. As regards swimming, it is my passion from the very childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now.

          The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see when watching the short videofilmvideo film about the daily routine of our school.
          The Area Around the School:
          I have madeconducted a little survey on the subject of my report and I have elucidadedelucidateddiscovered that most of the pupils of our school considerthink that the region and the area around school should be filmed first. Personally I agree with their statementopinion and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school. We should film our gardens around the school and athe pitch with the playgroundscourts for volley-ballvolleyball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning.
          Classrooms, Lessons and Breaks.
          NextThe next things to be shot, byaccording to the majority of students, was said to beshould be the teaching process and the breaks. Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better. Here I should also mention the decorationdecor of our classrooms and the atmosphere in them. People should see all the renovations that have been madedone during the last few years and all the modern conveniences that were madeinstalled for both students and teachers.

This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allowallowing me to gain valuable knowledge and experience.
          Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close withto nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.
          Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have mucha lot of experience inwith swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.

          How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up. I hear that it can be terrible at times. Guess what? Last month, I got to help out at a pop concert. It was a fantastic experience.
          The concert was held atin our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.
          Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements.
          I also helped inwith the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fixinstall new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
          I enjoyed fixinginstalling the studio equipment in particular. It gave me thea chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics. On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixingputting in bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers.

To make matters worse, you realise you forgethave forgotten to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket. It is a tough chore!
          Another point of viewargument against shopping is athe lack of the items that you really want.

          'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa. The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peopepeople and this book could have an influence on them.
          In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude totowards them. In some ways, he did not agree with ""Black Consciousness"" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in. In other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa.
          Although Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world.

          In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the goodexcellent quality of the music.

          First of all, and I think it's a big difference withvery different in England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me.
          Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, and be polite with the teacher and the other school childrenschoolchildren. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard,. I mean as regards the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them (though not always) but also speaks with them.
          At home it is different, each. Each family has its own rules. As I am concernedAs far as I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay up very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wiseclever child, so. So! Usually, usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules, like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your noisenose""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.

I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens. For men, sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners. Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town. And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like. The, the Sports Shopsports shop. You cannot losewaste the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive. And that is allwaysalways what we want. That's men's intention.

          Dear MisterSir,
          I recently had the opportunity to see ""over the rainbow"", which was playedperformed last week in the Circle theatre.
          I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I spenthad there. Actually, I read the advertismentadvertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes onin it.
          In fact, Danny Brook didn't playperform or appear on stage last Tuesday, thehis role was played by another - a quite bad - actor, less famous than Danny Brook.
          I'm also sorryannoyed because I had to wait 45 mnminutes before the piecesplay started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we wereare students) and no discount was proposedoffered or madegiven forto us. We had to pay £15 each for seeingto see a miserable piecesplay.
          After the pieceplay, we wanedwanted to eat at the theatertheatre restaurant but we couldn't. It was apparently closed and I'm asking you why.
          As you can see, there are some (volontaryvoluntarydeliberate?) mistakes onin the advertismentadvertisement you made. We didn't have a ""perfect evening out"" at all. That's why I'm asking you for givingto give us our money back.

          The best way to go shopping is when you thinkto think in advance about what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought.
          Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking.
          The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stresspressure or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!!

          I willwould prefer to have my accomodationstay in a tent, cousebecause in that way I can feel more clouseclosecloser to the nature, and I can remember when I was a scout girlgirl scout. Sleeping in a tent is much more exitingexciting and clousy than in a log cabin.
          At the camp I willwould like to choose two activities, Painting and Singing,. I love painting, in. In. At the university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint cousebecause I work in a bank and I have a baby. So I will be very happy to improve my art inat the camp. The reason offor my optionchoice forof singing is cousebecausethat I feel embarrestembarrassed about my voice, so maybe I could get it betterimprove it.
          I willwould like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souveniressouvenirs.

It didn't happen.
          To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I'veI'd never heard anything fromabout, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement dodoeshas.

          It is very thoughtful of you that you are takingto take all of us to London. This is a great oppotunityopportunity for me to explore and experience London myself, especially, The London fashion and leisure shows. Most of the shows are about fashinablefashionable things for the students in my age. I think it is a good programmeevent and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of the showsshow, for instance  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to make upput on make-up and how to have propiateappropriate hairstyles.
          In my opionionopinion, I think you should organisedorganisehave this programmeevent in the afternoon instead of going for shopping and move the shopingshopping timeslot into the afternoon on Wednesday.
          I hope this information will help you to understand and putinclude it in your programme. I trust you to pay immidiateimmediate attention to my suggestions.
          I am looking forward to hearing from you.

          Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins,. I think I preferlike both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places. I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place,. I think I will choose log cabins,; it'sitthey soundssound good and if I have time, maybe I can go tostay in tents next time (maybe next year.)).
          When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography. I can sing classicclassical music and pop music, seem like rock & roll. Maybe TITANIC. My mum likedlikes me singing this song. And I can also maketake very good photographyphotographs, because I learned to do this in China two years ago.

          Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences of fame, like not to havehaving a ""private life"" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place. I can imagine, how annoying it can be sometimes. Just thinkimagine that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends. There's really no way to be together just onlysimply with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by thesethe paparazzispaparazzi.

          Introduction
          After our English class'class's decision to make a short film about daily life in my school, I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed. The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them. Here are my findings.
          Best lessons to film
          As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest to filmfilming Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educativeeducational and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequatesufficient to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard.
          Interesting activities
          One event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutelydefinitely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent.
          Conclusion
          In conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video. Because the above mentioned events are the most praised or criticised ones by all studentsthe ones most praised or criticised by all students.

The Advertisementadvertisement is writtenwritesstates that you invite stars and artistartists from around the world.

I think you should invite people from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world. If you invite from more countries to stars and artistartistsinvite stars and artists from more countries, your festival will be unbelievedunbelievable. The Secondsecond point is there are some jazz, rock and classical concerts. It's a good idea but some concert halls are too small. Because of thesethis, people are bored quickly. You show plays and films. I congradulatecongratulate you because it'sthat's perfect. The most important thing is dance shows.

It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit.
          Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. PressThe press takes this demand as an order, and ""but the public wants to know"" becomes a nightmare for famous people.
          In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend tooso much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy.

          To make easier and faster this reportthis report easier and faster , it was necessary to make a questionariequestionnaire which was gavegiven out in the school.
          After collecting the answers, I obtained the following results:
          1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the listening room room and the library because, as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places that helpinghelp themthe students to improve their English on their own.
          2 - They also think, that through filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as ""one-to-one"" lessons, people who see this video, will bebecome interested onin knowing more about the school, because a few English schools have this sort of classesclass.
          3 - The least but not the lastLast but not least, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-activitiesextra-curricular activities organised by the social programme, hashave becamebecome really exciting, so. So they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example ""the full day in Oxford"" because for those thatwho did not have the opportunity to go there, could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time. However, 15% thougththought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.

He is only aiminglooking for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfullunsuccessful for 86 days. This day he is lucky. He getgets a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catchedcaught.

The fisherman kills many sharks with differentvarious weapons, but when he reaches port there is only the head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish. Mr. Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure. He makemakes you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks. The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr. Hemingway. This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it.

          It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two peopletwo people at the same time: herself and the houskeeperhousekeeper. Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it., I think that her husband only followed what she ordered himher orders. She was the headboss in this story.

          I think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time.
          A famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed.
          In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private lifelives of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far.
          For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasioninstance we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death.
          On the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous, itone has to accept also the disadvantages of bebeing famous.
          The famousFamous people must enderstandunderstand that the journalists are doing their workjob.
          In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without bebeing annoyed for the rest of the holiday.
          In conclusion I think that there must be more compehensioncomprehensionunderstanding and respect between famous people and the media.",3.71

          Dear Helen Ryan
          I am really pleased to hear from you that I won first prize in the competition. It is the thing I really want.
          HowNow I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter. First, I am afraid but I can travel onlyonly travel in July. I've got a three-month holiday from June to August but I've already promised my aunt, who runs a small nursing home in Andover, to help her during June and in August. I have to work to get my next-term tuition fee. So July is the only month I can take part in your activities. Second, regarding accomodationaccommodation, I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer.
          And I lovewould love to learn surfing and painting. I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing. So this time I am really keen on learning that. I also love painting. I expect you have lovely naturecountryside in California for me to draw on my canvas.
          Let me ask a question about clothes and money. What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take.?
          I am really looking forward to going there and to your reply.
          Yours faithfully

          I love shopping. But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable.
          For example, anyall shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping aton weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.
          However, people can't have a good time even aton weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service.
          For the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very botheringannoying unless shops have facilities for them.
          Despite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping. Otherwise they can have lots of problemproblems and it is difficult to live.",6.04

For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never again see itsee it again, or you could be robbed, or even if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time.

          The first idea about shopping is that buying something will makebe a pleasure tofor the buyer and, for that reason, will be enjoyable.
          But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try on. When you ask to, the sellersales person offenoften answers that your size is missingout of stock. HopefulHopefully, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the sellersales person for your size. His answer is: ""Everything is here, Madam!"" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size.

          First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has it'sits own idea of where it want'swants to go) between other desperate peoplepeople's baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or asome toothpaste. Especially thatas it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department storesstore. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop conludesconcludesends in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that?
          No. Most definitely, shopping is not an enjoyable activity and I can easily think of many, nicer ones.",8.1

          I am writing this letter to you in order to complain forabout the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; concretely on Friday evening.
          First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion aboutof your company, which is said to be the best exhibitorproducer of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended on the referred day to your theatreattended your theatre on the referred day with the aim of having a perfect evening.
          However, nothing was further from what really happened. In the beginningTo start with, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card. Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes overpast the announced timetabletime of the performance for the show to get started. And finally, when itthey wentcame on, we realised that thereit was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing.
          I hope you realise this was totally different from what you advertised, and I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future offering me some money back.

          First of all, the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove,. Tina did act, but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I don't recall.
          Second of all, the play was suposedsupposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. I'm not used to wastewasting my time sitting on a chair waiting, I do have better things to do with it.

Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp, deep look, Nevernever have I seen such a deep look:, and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer, in other words, hackhacking into the school software.
          I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were plannedscheduled to do.

          I heard somebody say, ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway.
          The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he hadhas caught. What makes the situation difficult is that noneneither of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or deathlife and death struggle.
          The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he baresbears everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping hold toof the line whereon which the fish is oncaught.
          The reader feels withfor him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.

          Dear Helen.,
          I've been thrilled eversinceever since I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently. In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the options and choicechoices that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen, along with some questions.
          Firstly, I wish to travel onin July as I already have plans for June, which isare to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacationsvacation commences.
          Secondly, toregarding the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much.
          Among the numerous choices of activities, I am considering taking those of golf and surfing. I have been playing golf since the age of 8, therefore I am certain that I will not require help of any sort. However, as this will be my first time to go surfing, I am willing to take classes for beginners.
          Lastly, I've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would lielike to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of the amount of money I will have spendto spend in the camp.
          I am looking forward into being received inat camp California.

          Dear Kim,
          Hi Kim. How are you?
          I am fine and so is my family.
          I was glad to receive youra letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert, I started writing as soon as I could.
          I thinthink it's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer! I had so much fun helping my friends' band havingputting on their concert.
          At first, they asked me to decorate the stage since I like drawing, but as I wanted to get more involved, they said that I could also help them set up the lights, the microphones and the instruments. I have to admit that it wasn't always easy, but my effort was worth every penny.
          The concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous! The audience seemed pretty impressed as well. I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together. I'm not sure of what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too.
          If you have any questions, please write to me.
          I wish you the best of luck and hope you have fun helping the singers as much as I did
          Lots and lots of kisses,

          In today's fast movingfast-moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food. When they are at home, especially children, parents take care of them and always prepare somea good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper.
          However, students who never have time for a healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins orand fibre usually finish on ""McDonalds"", and hamburgers or BicBig Macs. Moreover, very often the school canteen doesn't offer diversifiedvaried types of food, like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly andor in good proportions. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal - and even ifeven though the times were worsepoorer, people were more sensible.

          The boat trip you'reyou were asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized, there. There were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun! Here are some facts for you:
          The departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day, but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then (I know you hate getting up early, but...). After two hours of the cruise, there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours.

          I was very happy to receive your letter. I haven't heard from you for a long time, how. How are you? How is your sister, Marine?
          I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeableinteresting. We were also very lucky with the weather,; it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long. I think you should definetlydefinitely go and I'll try to help in whatany way I can.
          First of all I recommend you to gogo on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all theyour questions.
          I think you should take a packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle).
          I advise you to try the watersportswater sports as well, it's. It's a real laugh.
          I'm not sure how many students are therethere are in your class but they give reductions for groups of over 15 people so maybe you'll have to invite some friends to join you. By the way, I'd love to come with you, if it's possible! I really enjoyed our trip and I'm eager to see you again!

Some say it's evil, it spoils our eyes and personality, others say it's useful, enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality. But can each one of these people answer one simple question!? ""Could you live without television for a week?""
          I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the contraryon the other hand when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived for three weeks in a complete TV vacuumin a complete TV vacuum for three weeks,. I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings.
          You might ask me a normal question: ""What about the news?"" Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forgethave you forgotten about newspapers? And the radio (if you're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer themit to be read to you!)
          The biggest difference the absence of TV had mademade in my life was that I actually started living. I think everyone can say ""no"" to TV because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave. And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appritiateappreciate it and your life a lot more.",8.23

The college will arrange for a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive toat the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you to taketake a walkwalk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.
          As you already know, we are going to have thean end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a smallshort speech at the beginingbeginning, then itthere will be a buffet and a disco. You don't need to dress up smartly but please, make sure that your students don't wear shortshorts or trainers.
          Regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to taketake the students to our History MuseimMuseum. It's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people. There is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some sovenierssouvenirs for their families and friends.
          I hope I've answered all your questions but if you need anymoreany more information, please let me know.
          I am looking forward to seeing you all soon.

Cars takeplay a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learnare learning how to drive and choosechoosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time compercomparecompared to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait onat a bus stop onin a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or beingbe stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtracktrack repairs, you. You can just jump into a car, tune your radio ontoto your favourite station and have a plesantpleasant drive to your distanationdestination.
          Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as a fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this.
          From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relayrely on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted asome quality of life for my daughter and myself.
          Since I passed my driving test I can notcannot understand how I used to live without a car before. I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutellyabsolutely love it!",8.42

By rail: get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn. Turn left and the hotel is on your left handleft-hand side.

In addition, at the end-of-conference party, we also have a country dancing show. It could be very special because all the dancers are from our group.

          I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life. For example, I can travel to manya lot of places in the U.K. Especially, since I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire). Can you imagine if I hadn't got a car how could I go shopping, go to college and so onhow I could go shopping, go to college and so on if I hadn't got a car?
          In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go passpast my village but the bus fares isare very expensive for me. Apart from that it takes a long time to go somewhere.
          The car has largelysignificantly affected my own life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than by useusing public transportstransport. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music, whichas I brought some cassetscassettes with me from Thailand. I took a car driving theorydriving-theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a praticepractical driving test very soon. I think I have to drive the car myself, so that itI will know more about the advantages of using thea car.
          In conclusion, I think a car is very important to me and it has affected my own life. If I havehad more money I willwould buy another car. I think it has more advantages than disadvantages. So, we should say many thanks to the person who invented athe car!",7.25

I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it's very nice and cheap. It has comfortable bedrooms and a place for parties. You can book this hotel it's. It's the best and it's near to the conference it's. It's only 15 minutes by walkon foot.
          I think that it will be nice aboutfor the end-of-conference party if you will inviteinvite somebody to sing and give to the studentstudents the time to enjoy theirselvesthemselves and to dance. The party it will be nice. The clothes nowNow the clothes that they will wear it hashave to be smart, not howthe kind you would wear if you arewere going to a casino for example but nice casual, not with sports shoes or T-shirts.
          On the last day in the afternoon thatwhen you have three ourshours free you can go for coffee or to visitvisit some places.
          Those are my ideas for the conference. I hope that you will like itthem.

          The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice. Even if the architectural style may seem a bit 'heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similarreal comparison all overanywhere in the world.
          2. Exposition
          Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching timeexperience that people get nevernever get tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures ofin each section of the museum.
          3. Restaurant
          The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyablegood as well. The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice. In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum.
          To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommonunusual architecture and a quiet restaurant where you will be able to have a rest if you need to.",5.37

          Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is the 'Palace Hotel'. Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference. Thirdly, the end-of-conference party wouldwill be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you couldcan wear something quite casual.
          Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest you to visitvisit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum, as both of them are very interesting and have thea student discount.

Linking to the internetInternet was so popular. The Internet was something amazing for me. Can you thinkimagine you have every piece of information you need whenever you want it? Can you thinkimagine you can contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want to?
          I meet a lot of people on the internetInternet and it really interestinterests me. I learn a lot about their culture by speaking to them on the internetInternet. I wasn't able to imagine this before. In addition to this, today companies can do nothing without a computer. Everything in this world workswill work with computers from now on.

Taking itthat into consideration I would like to say that the computer is thea priceless invention for an accountants, designers, engineers and so on and on. Another point in their favouradvantage is thetheir possibilityability to connect to the Internet. It allows you to have all the necessary information ""on your fingertipsat your fingertips"". Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world.
          On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with thea virtual world, which computers create. Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to the increasing of unemployment.

          Place
          This castle is situated in the centre of the town and surrounded by woods. InsideThe inside of the castle is always dark, even in the daytime.
          Story
          It is 500 years old, and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost. She appears occationalyoccasionally and opens every window in the castle. It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there and fell out of the window. People said she was seeking something and is still seeking it even ifthough she hadhas been dead for 500 years.

          The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture offrom the 16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful. I think it is worth whileworthwhile to seeseeing it.

          The principal reason is the cheapestcheap price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if youthere are more than 10 people, you can havepay a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solutionoption might be the best way to visit this museum.

          You shouldwould have probably heard about the mummy who sleepshas slept there for about two thousand years... You can see it in the dungeon. So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide. I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice hollidayholiday in Yverdon.

This is only because nowadays people have more money than evenever before, and some women don't earn money, they. They have no idea how diffcultdifficult it is to earn the money. Women just love spending money in shops. Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs, will. Will those women still thinkingthink shopping is enjoyable! So it is dependdepends on differentthe case.
          ForAs for me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I onlynever go to shopshopping unless I really need something. Shopping is just like a nightmare to me,. I think I will never understand why people love shopping. How can you facelook at the same goods at the same shop all the time. I think most men have the same opinion as I do.
          Some women spend their whole life doing shopping, and most of the timestime, they don't buy many things. In my eyes they are wasting their lifeslives, they are hopeless.
          Those are only my opinions, you. You don't need to agree with itthem, but one day you might foundfind out that what I have said is not totally wrong.",9.0

          I am writing to you to give you some opinions of mine abutabout The International Arts Festival.
          It was a great idea and I had the pleasure of resting and relaxing, plus of gettingacquiring some important knowledge from it. On the other hand there were some disadvantages: 1. StarsThe stars and artists weewere only fromfrom only six countries.
          2. Some concert halls were too small. So it was impossible to get tickets there.
          3. I think that there were notdon't think that there were enough plays and films.

It would be wonderful to buy some books or programmsprogrammes with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival. Also I think that the dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g. the national dancingdance of all the countries) to impress the audience and not to bore with the similar scenes.

          Dear Ms Jane Clark,
          I am writing to express my profound gratitude for anthe excellent organisation of anthe annual international arts festival, where I spent two days. The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows.
          However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. BesidesAlso, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones.
          As a matter of fact, I consider one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events to be brilliant as it offers a unique opportunity to pay for everything all together and be able to attend different events.
          I believe your festival to be a great event in our cultural life and I am convinced that it is a success. I look forward to coming to the festival again.

          For a startTo start with I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook, and they make us feel and think.
          As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despiteregardless of the fact what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and the people around usour own life and the people around us better. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantasticfantastical story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday'severyday routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the worldworld's treasurehousetreasure house of literature and arouses an irresistableirresistible fascination.
          To draw the conclusionIn conclusion, I'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantasticfantastical stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves.",5.14

          I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play ""Over The Rainbow"" and I must say that I gotwas rather disappointed.
          First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes. Also, your advertisement sign says that discounts are available. WhatThat is quite notnot quite true because when I asked for itone, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding, ""noNo"".
          When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differentlycontrary fromto what the advertisement sign says, whatwhich really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.
          But my complaints are not over yet. After the disappointing performance of the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also differing fromin contrast to what was said on the advertisement sign, it was closed. There was only a small sign stampedstuck on the door, saying that it was ""closed for repairs"".

But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buywhat you buy is for your health you will go shopping with much morea far greater consiousnessconsciousness and more joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look aton it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your behaviour ofapproach to shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the internetInternet and use e-business and online-shoppingonline shopping to order your pants for example.
          This is even an appropriatea good way to get around the unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home afterbefore you have orderedorder them by e-mail! Another solutionway to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop.
          You have been presented with some causesreasons why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of itmaking it more fun. It depends on every individual to change your mind and actbehave aslike a 'smart' shopper.",5.12

          As I arrived there after 5 P.M., I missed the first performance, so I decided to see the 19:30 p.m performance. HoweverBut it started at 20:15! Furthermore there were no student discounts!
          The worst onething was that the actor and actress were not the personpeople who had been written about in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed. So, I could not concentrate on the show.
          After the show, when I went to the restaurant it was closed, because it usually opens between afternoon and evening shows.
          It was a really disappointing evening! So I am asking for some money back.

          From the list of all the activities I have choosenchosen photography and golf. Since secondary school I amhave been very interested in taking pictures and I have a bigbroad experience inof it. I have choosenchosen golf because I have never played in this game.
          Please, send me any information ofabout what should II should take with me. Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply.

          My friend offered me a job as a member of the techicaltechnical staff onat Sting's concert. I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew.
          Our job was to prepare the scenestage. We've built it using ready metal and woddenwooden parts. It was really big and impressive. Then we had to plug in all electric instruments, speakers, lights and microphones. I was working with a specialist who had to connect all the lights together to one computer and prepare a colorfulcolourful show. It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure of working with professionalistsprofessionals.
          It was a hard and complicated job but we all had a lot of satisfaction during the concert. Even Mr. Sting came to us to thank us for our help.

          I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea. I spent two nice days watching its events. I was there with my boyfriend. We have similar interests but we have different opinions. For me - the dancesdance shows were absolutellyabsolutely wonderful. I like dancing and I like watching dancesdance shows. The Dancersdancers wornwore nice clothes, and the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefereprefer them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so itthey needsneed more room. I like listening to the classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was excitingexcited about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers. He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person. We had no time to watch all the plays and films. We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the evantsevents because we could change our planesplans during the evantevent.

Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year.

Finally, food shops should be added into this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractiveattractive enoughtenough to get audiences.

          How are you? I know you have been waiting for my letter. But as you know, I have been so busy that I couldn't write earlier.
          Actually I didn't use to enjoy pop music much. My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try the whole new experience of helping at a pop concert. I thought it would be the last thing I wanted, but it wasn't. I've really enjoyed this opportunity. We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers. We also helped to make posters and leaflets, which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing.
          The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audiencepeople from the countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most fromabout this experience? I've foundI found pop music so wonderful, it changed my ideaopinion of that classicclassical music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too.

Then the show alreadyactually started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show.

          Dear Mr. Clark,
          I'm writing this letter to complain and to suggest something about your ""International Arts Festival"". I visited the festival for 2 days. I also read an advertisement in ""The Times"". I thought it would be interesting and exciting. When I visited the festival, of course, it was really good.
          I was impressed ofwith the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different culturecultures and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days at the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for a student too.
          However, you said ""Stars and artists from around the world"" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts'concert halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time. Except for these two things, it was quite good.
          I'd like to suggest this - concerned withconcerning plays and films. Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were badthere weren't enough. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival.

          Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far muchmore than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntrationconcentration toon themy studystudies and I spent the money toon entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old.
          Secondly, I made a brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computercomputers at that time. Also I was leader of the computer usercomputer-user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was a part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer workswork. I could earn money, and also II also got a career.
          Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficulthard, but I think that was an easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So the loseloss was bigger than the profit.
          In conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose a proper part-time job. Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge. You must consider the purpose too. If you haven't a purpose, you wouldwill waste money easily and quickly.",10.04

As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in a photograher'sphotographer's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the cathegorycategory of ,,beautiful scenery''.

Firstly there was no available discountdiscount available, asthough you saidpromised one onin your advertisement, so even my 6 year old6-year-old son was charged the adult price. Then everything was going well untilluntil the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well. Well it didn't, it. It started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And Byby the way may I ask you how up to dateup-to-date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vertadvert saying the staringstarring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an otheranother actor and one I had never heard of. That was a dissapointmentdisappointment for my whole family, infactin fact. In fact all the viewersaudience wherewere very dissappointeddisappointed.
          Anyway the show was nowhere asnowhere near as good as it was mentionedmeant to be and it was definatelydefinitely worse than I had expected it to be,. I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes, desparatelydesperately searching for your restaurantsrestaurant, our stomachesstomachs rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what dowould you know?, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks!

          One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictlyfirmly to keep it a secret, especially from the other groups.

But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was anoyedannoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it., exeptexcept a few phcycopsycho groups, some. Some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meannesmeanness of it.
          That night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves exeptexcept Pat, who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early.

          However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend. It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March. It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm. The show will be about all the latest fashionfashions, leisure and sports wear, make upmake-up and hairstyles. We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students.
          This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we. We might also get a changechance to meet new people and interestinteract with them. The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a changechance to go.
          I have a few suggestionsuggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in . We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can, however, go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show.
          Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show. I hope you wouldwill consider this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.

          By the way, how is your new school? DidDo you like it more than the previous one?
          I must say that our school rules are quite different thanto yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missedmiss a lesson, that could because a troubleproblem for yourselfyou. I think it depends on the school. PrivatPrivate schools have a more relaxed atmosphere thatthan the state schoolschools. They don't have strikestrict rules and students can take extra lessons.
          On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behavioursbehaviour areis punished. For example, you have to do more homeworkshomework or they are sendingsend you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed atin any part of the scholschool.
          I have a relaxed family and we are sharingshare all the houseworkshousework. My Fatherfather does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidyingtidy up!

This is why gossip magazines are so popular. Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep into their private lives to satisfy us.

It's an exhibition of fashions, sport wearssportswearssportswear, make upmake-up and hairstyles. We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who likewant to study fashionsfashion after leaving this school. And everyoneevery one of us is interested in fashions and clothes! This exhibition is situated in the Central Exhibition Hall, London.
          We've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday, the 14th of March. Could we change our programme?

          You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of the English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for itthem. Why? Because he especially concentrates on the history, social lifesociety and politicpolitical situation inof the time the story is playedset. That mightcan be quietquite complicateddifficult to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write bookswrites books especially for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite interedinterested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him!
          I've sendsent you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book. Please read it and write your comments. I hope to hearinghear from you soon! Have fun with it and say hello to your cousin! See you soon!

I strongly agree with this. Firstly, most people mightcan remember the sad story of ""Princess Diana"" she. She died in Paris a few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called ""PaparachPaparazzi"". If she was nothad not been followed by journalists, she wouldn't diehave died. So, this fact shows obviously that famous people without a private life couldcan bebecome the victimvictims.
          But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion. Moreover, people are interested in their life stylelifestyle. I think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after ""Princess Diana's"" accident.
          However, secondly, famous people are not ""ailenalien"" so that they might do something, for example, ashameshameful things in a public space, or argumentargue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us. So they can be just ordinalyordinary people like us. We have to think about it this way.

          First of all I would like to say that organising an International Arts Festival was a great idea. I enjoyed it and found it worthyworth to visitvisiting.
          The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with the stars and artistartists coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get usedacquainted towith more cultures by inviting guests from some other countries too.
          The concert halls were not big enough to let all the guests in. So I could hardly participatedparticipate inattend all of the concerts.
          The organisation was very good. I found chances to see dance shows, art exhibitions and to listen to writers, but there could be more plays and films next year.
          It was really a reasonably-pricedreasonably priced weekend for me, but you should also recogniseintroduce new activities like competitions onin singing songs, or drawing a portrateportrait next year. Then it would be excellent.
          Thanks for everything.
          Yours Sincerelyfaithfully,",5.9

          I have received your letter. It is nice to hear from you again. I'm in a hurry, so I will directly comecome directly to the point.
          Everywhere and at everytimeevery time in our lives we faceare faced with the rules. Some findview them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them. For me they are both.
          At schoolsschool we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk. I think these are international rules which help things to goprogress in order.
          ContraryOn the other hand there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing onesones about clothing. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and we feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in what we wearingwear. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the classcourse. They don't care if we have problems, exams to study for or if we are ill.
          At homeshome we have againagain have rules, but more flexible ones. You should be punctual when coming to the dining table, respectful, do your home workshomeworkshomework and watch TV less and not too loud.
          I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have the enough power. They are against democracy I think.
          Anyway hope to hear from you soon.

          I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it.
          Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announceannouncedsaid in your advertisement.
          Secondly, I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were takentook place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showedshown were interesting,. In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year. Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buybuying only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them.

It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm7.00pm, so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon.

It's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salalysalary. If you are interested in teaching and responsible enough, you'll probably become an excellent teacher.
          Stop complaining about a lack of money and let's start working to have a new world. You'll find that your life is becoming more and more enjoyable!",7.18

          I went to the Circle theatre last week on mondayMonday and I would say that I had a very disappointing evening, there.
          Firstly, I'veI'd read in the advertisement that the actors who were playing that night were D. Brook and T. Truelove. Now you can guess how disappointed I was when I saw that there were different (and worse) actors!
          Secondly, the musical show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.. so I had to wait forty-five minutes outside and it was raining cats and dogs!
          And then I discovered that the discounts were not available for the tickets. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show and I was really hungry because I hadn't had my dinner that evening in order to be on time for the show.
          To sum up, Itit wasn't a ""perfect evening out"". I'd rather say that it was a catastrophe! And I am really sorry, but consequently I would ask you for some money back. Thank you for considering my request.

          I am really pleased to be the winner of your competition and I cannot help thinking about the two weeks in the USA.
          First of all, I would like to travel only in June, given that my wife will come with me:; her holidayholidays are only in June.
          Concerning accommodation at Camp California, would it be possible to livestay in a log cabinslog cabin? Indeed, myMy wife is afraid of sleeping in tents.
          Moreover, I practicepractiseplay Basketballbasketball in a famous French Clubclub:; Thatthat is the reason why I would like to choose the Basketballbasketball. If I had to chosechoose an otheranother activity, I think I would do Photographyphotography. In fact, this activity seems to be very interrestinginteresting. Unfortunately, I have never practicedpractisedtried but I feel to likelike discoveringtrying thatit.
          Finally, I would wantlike to ask you whether we hadhave to bring any money:. Life is so expensive there! Furthermore, what sort of clothes must we have for the different activities?
          I hope my answers will satisfy you. I thank you again.

          the morning
          That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all the students come ininto the classclassroom. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who makesmade the film. Furthermore, as Mathematicsmathematics areis the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film at a time wherewhen we are in the MathClassmaths class.
          the lunch
          After that we could comego to the lunch, which takes two hours per day. The betterbest thing to do would be to presentshow the cooking personnalpersonnel forbecause they are very nice.
          the afternoon
          We could begin the afternoon with the sport, showing the different places with their surroundings (near the wild): it would give a good impression. I advise to finishfinishing with a lesson of Chemistrychemistrychemistry lesson so that people see the laboraterylaboratory. Before that, I would have showedshown the break at 3 o'clock, which is important for us.",3.79

          I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me for an address. I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie. Yes!!! I couldn't believe it.
          He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible. So, I started to speak in English with him. I explained to him where was the streetthe street was that he was looking for and we carried outon with the conversation for a while.
          I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very simply.
          I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address. Yeah!!! I'm not joking, I got his e-mail.

Next, Oneone reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also a fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything bywith thethat ticket.

While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in factin fact only from six countries. The number of plays and films werewas also very fewsmall. In addition to that some concert halls were too small for the audience to enjoy the concerts.

Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars from more than six countries and rebuildbuild larger concert halls.

          First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from onlyonly from six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some of the concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for all the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing the dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive.

          Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people notdon't.
          If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some timessometimes you cando not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoyare enjoying themselves a lot.
          On the other hand there are some disadvantages. forFor example if you are a working mother with three children, thatwhich means you are always nin a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shoppingshop in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.
          You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it is very crowded and you spend more time thankthan you preferwould like to.

          As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions ofconcerning this short video. I found that most of them had suggestedsuggested that four lessons should be filmed, which are as follow:
          1. GrammerGrammar, which is the basebasis of learning English.

          2. TeacherTeachers are helpinghelp students with their problems. If you have a problem on studingstudying, try asking the teachers about which is the best way to study.

You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it, or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn.

According to your advertismentadvertisement the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15.

          Dear Tim,
          I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II was always on the search forin search of answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to prooveprove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure"".
          I hope you will enjoy it! Please let me know!
          I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
          Kind regards

          Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Maybe this is how my story begins.
          Well first of all, Pat was a very good friend of mine. He was really a good friend, until something had happenedhappened.
          I was attending college, as I normally do. With nothing to lose, at all, but on the contrary, with a lot to learn from.
          I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I lovesloved. Yes, I think this was the only reason. His name was Cody. He was a very handsome and good lookinggood-looking boy. But far from thatmore than that, he was a very kind person.
          Pat told me that he was also in love with me. He told me that it was nessarynecessary to do something about it. But I didn't know what to do.
          Pat suggested meI to talktalk to him. But I really didn't managedmanage to do so.
          As Pat was lossinglosing his patience, he decided to talk to him. I can say that I was very nerviousnervous orand anxious about what was going to happen. He didn't keptkeep my secret.
          Pat told him that I was in love with him. This was my secret and now it was not. But even so, I think it was for the best, he was also in love with me.
          But on the other hand I will never trust in Pat.",7.93

When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and it's harder to find it.

          They haven'tdon'tdidn't respect the timetable, the show hadwas meant to begunbegin at 19:30 and heit started at 20:15 how. How can you explain this faultmistake?!
          But it'sI am not finishfinished, you wrote onin the paper ""Discounts available"" but it wasn't true,; it was a very badly organisationorganised. After this bad show we had wantwanted to go to the Restaurant for a drunkdrink and ateto eat something and it was closed and nobody had explainedexplained to us why the Restaurant wasn't open.
          So, I'm very angry when I think about this evening, and I want to have my money back. I think it's the minimum you have to do for me.

          Firstly, I would like to travel to Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June. Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp.
          Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool, so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that.
          Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would be appreciatedappreciate it if you supplysupplied some towerstowels, if possible.

          It took place in athe Korea national center which wasis the biggest building in Korea. There were a lot of people, I guess over 50,000, who wanted to see famous singers and listen to their songs.
          I helped to guide foreginersforeigners who would like to take participatedparticipate in that. You know, I have studied English for two years in England. That's why I could attend to that concert as a volunteer, because they needed people who could speak English very well.

          To answer your first question, I would like to travel onin julyJuly if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at thisthat time of the year.
          InRegarding the accomodationaccommodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, hewhich is going to be more funnyfun, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question.
          I can see inon the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quietquite good. (I finished 5th atin the EnglandEnglish Golf tourtournament juniorJuniorJunior Golf Tournament  in 1999), and basketball, because I would like to discoverrediscover this sport I only used to play at school.
          I've got other questions: wichwhichwhat type of clothes do I have to bring? Can I change money on the campuscamp? Are someany partyparties organized during the holidays? Is there only one teatcherteacher for each sport, and how many are we in each group of activities?

          First, I think we can'tdon't think we can shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks, because thisthese two elements are representative of athe daily life at school, aren't they?
          First, we should film some lessons because everybody knowknows (or rememberremembers for theif they are growns upgrown-ups) that itthis is the activity that to beistakes up the most of a studentstudent's time at school.
          Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a daily schoolschool day! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freefreely, and there are no teatchersteachers, it.  It could be a good contrast to the seriousseriousness of the lessons. To come back to a strictthe central (a little beat less) subject, I suggest that we film the sportsports lesson , doing.  Doing that will allowedallow the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups.
          Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment to relax for the students, and for the teatchersteachersfor the students, and for the teachers, to relax, we.  We mustn't forget to film the teatcherteacherstaff room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teatchersteachers.",5.36

I was so happy and suprisedsurprised that I firstfirst I could not really believe it.  But it was true. My priceprize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at thetheir concert. The pop group which was going to actplay is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.)). But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. IIt started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering, which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anythingI was not able to eat anything either. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guidingguided tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognisedrealised that they arewere very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and, I have to tell you, they didgave a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like ""Did you like the performance!?"" or ""HowWhat do you think about the first group?"" Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they.  They were not conceited or somethinganything like thisthat. They were like any other personpersonspeople and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days inof my life.

We think that it could be a great chance in order to knowlearn about British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies.
          We would like to know if it couldwould be possible to introduce a little change in our programme. Our question is: instead of going to the shopping on Tuesday, in the afternoon, could we go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show?
          I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing your reply.
          Yours sincerely,

          Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents. Firstly, log cabins are more comportablecomfortable than tents. Secondly, I do not like tents. Last not leastLast but not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days.
          As I hadhave been asked to choose two activities I would like to do during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing. I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new. As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I gettake lessons in it. I just love singing.
          I would like to know whether there isare some facilities for washing the Clothes. Especially in summer, clothes get dirty very easily.

          When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accesoiresaccessories etc. and buying them. It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be.
          Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search offor an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends.
          Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without ""touching"" the others. It gets enormously unbearable inon hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes, if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out.
          Of course, shopping is not always so unpleasant, but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home.",5.49

Maybe it is right sayto say that in a flat instead of a building. I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan. Most of them are flats which have at lestleast 20 Floors. It means the Japanese are planning for the future home.

          But one more thing, I believe these flats'll have a park for people who'll be living in therethem. And because it'll be a big building we'll be able to see a wholegreat view through the window.

          Thank you very much for your letter. I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions!
          In connection with the questions you asked, please find my answers as follows:
          - I couldwould prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave.
          - As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become cumbersomeawkward tofor me.
          - My choice of sports are swimming and tennis. Swimming has always been my favourite sport and I can say that I have become an excellent swimmer over the years. Tennis I only started four years ago, but have found that I am quite talented at it, having won several competitions during the last two years or so.

          An internationinternational arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were startsstars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the possibilityopportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
          In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favoritefavourite classicclassical concertconcerts, ""La Moldava"" by Smetana. Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enoughenough money, it willwould be better to have the possibilityopportunity to watch more movies.
          I am glad to tell you that one reasonably-pricedreasonably priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because also people who do not have a lot of money can enjoy the festival.

In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in the National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited thisthese two places before. So we decidedecided to choose the otheranother programmeevent which have seen as an entertainment. It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show iswill be holdheld at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is on Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions, including leisure and sports wear.

          However, we would like to say, that recently thean advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show has been seen by one of your English class studentstudents. The show will be about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make upmake-up and hairstyles.
          In our opinion, we should go to the show. Firstly, because we are keen on fashion. SecondalySecondly, because we do not have to pay for the tickets.
          We have already orgonisedorganised our visit in a new programme. The show is on tuesdayTuesday and we could go to see the show in the afternoon, instead of going shopping. We think, that we maycan go shopping the next day, on wednesdayWednesday, in our free time.

          The future is unexpectableunpredictable and human beings are afriadafraid of dangers, such as tornadotornados or earthquakeearthquakes. Thinking about home likeas a place to live, is not already worth. We must think about home from otheranother point of view. We need to make our home a place where we want to come back to after the work or school. It has to be a pleasure to be there for us. What we really need in the next milleniummillennium is love, that is what will keep all the family together and forever. Do we care about a new carpet or a fashionable furniture? No;, I do not think so. LiveLife is too short to think about the poscesivespossessivespossessions.
          TheOur houses will change because of new technologetechnology, whatwhich may make our livelifelives more comfortable. Everything will be faster. We will get used to that. What depends on us, is how the atmospheratmosphere we will have in our houses. The home of the Futurefuture, for me, is a place of hapinesthappiness.
          We cannot be aware of future technologetechnology, but we might still have some feelings tofor eachotherseach other.",12.38

Finally, I cleaned the stage again. My workswork werewas for the singers, so I could meet singers and talk togetherwith them.
          Do you know ""Radio Head""? It is my favourite group. I was able to have some signaturesautographs offrom them. It's brilliant, isn't it?
